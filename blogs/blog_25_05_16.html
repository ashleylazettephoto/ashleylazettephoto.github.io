		<h3>DAMILOLA</h3>
		<p>It’s always really cool to reconnect with people that you once knew. Seeing what they’re doing, where they work, what they now choose to invest their time in. Chatting with Dami was the perfect example of this. We used to know each other from school and summer camp, and then we parted ways as I graduated and she finished her last school years.</p>
		<p>If you know me then you know that I’m pretty bad at staying in touch. I think of you, creep your social media accounts, and then forget to actually send you a message. However it worked out that Dami’s new vlog made it’s way onto my newsfeed and I was so delighted to see it! Dami is funny, creative, courageous, and thoughtful. She isn’t afraid to share what she cares about. She isn’t shy or embarrassed about what she believes in, which is why I think her video channel will be an amazing watch. Lucky for me, she agreed to sit down with me to chat about her latest adventures and snap some pics of this beautiful woman.</p>
		<p><em>So why did you start your video blog?</em></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are so many conversations happening right now and I wanted to share in that. People are finally starting to talk about things that were pushed aside for so long, so it feels good to be able to share my voice too. It’s basically just all about my passions, what I think is funny, and my life. Everything is in video now so I wanted to create something that people would want to watch, and look forward to listening to what I had to say.</span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you want the world to take from your videos?</span></em></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want them to see me for me, and to see me being honest with them. I’m just trying to figure my life out and I know that everyone is doing the same. Everyone expects you to have your life together by the time you turn 21, but It’s not like that in real life. We all just need to see how valuable we are! We are all important, special, unique. We just need to embrace that and open up to people. I want people to see me being me, and take that as encouragement to be themselves too. </span></p>

		<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could give your 15-year-old self some advice, what would you tell her?</span></em></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d tell her that she’s enough! I spent so much time caring about what other people think because society told me that I was boring and forgettable. Now that I’m older I know that I have value and that I am loved and appreciated. I just wish I got to know myself sooner.</span></p>
		<p><em>That sounds like something you’re passionate about; helping people understand that they are enough.</em></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! Your value isn’t in the passing things like clothes and popularity. Your value is in the way you treat others and the way you choose to live your life. It has to be your decision to see your worth and there is so much freedom in that. </span></p>
		<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is coming next for your videos?</span></em></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that exams are done I’m going to put more time into them. I have so many ideas that I cannot wait to share with everyone!</span></p>
