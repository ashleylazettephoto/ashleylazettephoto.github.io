		<h3>AMY & KAI</h3>
		<p>Amy has been a close friend of mine since she first moved to Calgary. It wasn't long before she told me that she was pregnant, and then sweet little Kairo Elijah was born. He's basically the sweetest little babe, and is completely okay with the fact that I have no idea how to play with babies. Amy recently started a blog where she talks about motherhood in a very real, honest way. It's not just about the pretty pictures and cute little clothes, but also about her life as a young mama. We decided to take some pictures in her art-filled home, so I spent the afternoon with her and her little babe. Why do I only do in-home family photos?
</p>
<p>Your kids are more comfortable in their own home than they are in a grassy field.  Your kids will be more likely to smile at me when they are in their comfy clothes (which can still be super cute as you can see from Kai's little outfits!) and when they get to play on their own couch. I find it much easier to get genuine smiles and laughter from you as a family when you are all super comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Home is where the heart is. Blankies, stuffed animals, and favorite books can really bring out who your family is. I love seeing the lived in personality of your home! It really shows off the uniqueness of your family. I think people worry about the mess or not having a “hip” home, but those things really don't matter when you are cuddling in bed with your little human. We can capture the little moments of snack time, bath time, and even nap time. All these little moments at home create such a lovely environment for photographs.
</p>
<p>As an artist, I struggle with formal family portraits. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting gorgeous family pictures with everyone smiling and dressed up. They can also be personal, unique, and fun. However, that's not my best work. I used to do photos like this and struggled, creating images that I just wasn't proud of. I realised that it wasn't the families or the inspiration, it was me. I am not the kind of photographer who thrives with formal family portraits. And that's okay. I used to think I had to do everything in order to call myself a photographer, but there are a million other photographers who specialize in those types of photos! So I decided to only offer the type of session that I know I can create beautiful art in.
</p>
<p> If you're looking for photographs capturing your in-home cuddles, I would love to chat! And if you're a mom (or just a blogger looking for a good read) please check out Amy's blog! She is funny and charming and will make your trip worth-while. She's also the kindest person you'll ever meet, so be sure to send her an e-mail to chat. http://www.motherandalover.com 
Thanks for reading with me, and I hope you enjoy some of my favorite pictures from Amy + Kai's session!
