		<p><u>Tell us a bit about yourself! How would you describe your style? How many years have you been in the photography industry?</u></p>

		<p>My photography style is documentary. Capturing real life, love and interaction. The authenticity of natural, candid expression and emotion. I believe it is so important to take time to preserve and capture the realness of who we are, and the life we are living, in it's truest sense.
		I have always carried a love for taking photographs, but professionally, I have been in the photography industry for 7 years. I am continually seeking out ways to up my creativity and knowledge.

		<p><u>Where do you find your inspiration when you feel creatively drained?</u></p>

		<p>When I feel a creative lull, I find it best to take a break and take a step back from photographing for a bit. I find spending time outdoors, and observing the beauty of creation ignites the spark. Every so often, I will also do a fun, creative session- just for me. This also ignites and refuels the creative “spark”.</p>
		<br>

		<p><u>Are there any products or software that you would recommend to beginner photographers? (ie editing products, workshops, gear)</u></p>
		<p>Don’t worry about having a massive amount of gear right from the beginning, start simple and learn what lenses you’ll actually need. Focus on your craft. I always encourage people i’m mentoring to start by renting a few different types of lenses to get a feel of what works for your style. Once you settle into your style more, you will have a better sense of what gear is best suited for you. As far as editing- Lightroom has always been my go-to.</p>

		<p><u>What was one thing that you wish you had done sooner? Something that really “changed the game” for you?</u></p>

		<p>Value my work and my images more. Value my time, creativity, and art. I undervalued my time and worth for too long and lowered my prices just to ensure I would get bookings. Quality vs. quantity. Understanding your worth in all ways is foundational.</p>
		<br>

		<p><u>Is there anything that you struggle with in this industry?</u></p>

		<p>It’s a very big + competitive industry, and can feel overwhelming at times. When I first started, I struggled with self-confidence. I find photography is a type of business that heavily relies on and thrives on word of mouth marketing, promotion and referrals. I had to step up my confidence a lot, and stay clear of the comparison game. Yes, there are hundreds upon hundreds of photographers, but each one still carries their own special uniqueness.</p>

		<p><u>Family photography and Wedding photography can sometimes feel like two completely different industries! How do you create a brand that works for any project that you do?</u></p>

		<p>Yes, they are definitely very different industries! I brand myself more-so as a documentary + lifestyle photographer, and do not put an emphasis on one of the other (family/weddings). I try to post enough variety of each to ensure I am reaching all audiences that I want to target. Yes, they are different industries, but the style that I capture (candid/documentary) does not differ between the two.</p>
		<br>
		<p><u>What is your absolute favorite thing about being a photographer?</u></p>

		<p>I think the connections and relationships that I have built over the years. Having the opportunity to capture such important aspects of peoples lives, and often times seeing and capturing return couples/families over the years is such a privilege and blessing.</p>

		<p><u>Tell us about your workshop!</u></p>

		<p>It was such a wonderful experience! For me it was about creating a space for women to come together and create freely without judgement or stress. I wanted to create a community that would encourage growth and creativity. The workshop starts with a few hours of business talk, covering all the basics. We then do a variety of shoots so they have experience shooting in different scenarios, while providing a variety of content for their portfolios. We spent 9 hours together talking, laughing and creating. By the end of the day, I saw that lifelong connections and friendships had been established.</p>
