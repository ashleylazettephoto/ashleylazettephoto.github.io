		<h3>MINI BUT MIGHTY</h3>
		<p>Forrester was born on October 14<sup>th</sup>, 2015. That may not seem like a crazy birthday, but given that her due date was supposed to be 10 weeks after that, it is a very important part of her story.</p>
		<p>Reedan and Ben were excitedly preparing for the birth of their little girl when Reedan’s water broke. After arriving at the hospital, it seemed that her labour wasn’t able to be stopped and she went into surgery. Forrester was born and immediately put into NICU weighing only 3lbs 7oz. It was just 30 weeks that she had spent growing, stretching, and kicking. Reedan talks about the time that Forrester spent in intensive care in a way that I could never understand. She talks about how proud she was of her baby for passing her tests (like feeding and being in a carseat) and how she couldn’t have done it without her partner Ben. Her schedule consisted of waking up at 6am, being driven to the hospital by Ben, then staying with Forrester all day through her various weighing, feeding, and cuddling. At around 6 Ben would pick up Reedan to have dinner, then they would both return until visitation time was up. They didn’t care what it took just as long as they could go be with their baby girl. Not a lot of parents have this option in NICU (having other kids, being single mothers, financial needs) and so both Ben and Reedan are thankful for the time that Reedan got to spend at the side of their daughter.</p>
