		<h3>AMY & SIDNEY</h3>
		<p>I met Amy when she first moved to Calgary and began working with me at Starbucks. She immediately introduced herself with confidence and a smile, two things that she is never without. We became close friends and within weeks I began to realize just how special Amy is. Her life has been a whirlwind since she was 2 years old, but has never let anything hold her back from loving every minute it. She holds her head up high and is endlessly kind to everyone she meets. And I mean genuinely kind to people that she has no connection to, but is willing to see that everyone faces their own battles.</p>
		<p>When Amy told me she was pregnant I was really scared for her. Babies are like, a big deal. But after seeing how excited she was to be a mom, my panic was eased because I knew that if any one of my friends could do it, it would be her. She loves her friends so, so much. She is passionate about doing what makes you happy, and being with people that she cares for is doing exactly that. Knowing that Sidney is the father makes me happy too. In the short time that Iâ€™ve known him I can tell you three things: He loves family, kids, and making people happy. All of these things will help him love this baby and be an awesome dad. Did I mention that they are a super cute couple? They make each other happy and I know that they will both put this baby before everything else.</p>
		<p>I am so, so excited to meet this little bae-by and to love this little family even more. Congrats Amy + Sid!</p>
		<p>xoxo Ashley</p>
