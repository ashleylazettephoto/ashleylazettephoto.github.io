		<h3>THE PETERSON FAMILY</h3>
		<p>I first met Robyn when she become my new manager at work. It might seem awkward that I took my boss’ maternity and newborn photos, but it was actually so relaxed and fun. Robyn and her husband Tom are so easy-going that taking photos of them felt like we were just hanging out.</p>
		<p>I’ve seen a lot of posts and photos online that talk about how amazing parenting is and how it’s the best thing anyone could ever do (which I have no doubts that for some people it is), but sometimes parenting isn’t this picture-perfect moment. Sometimes your kid is annoying and you haven’t cleaned your house in three weeks and that’s totally okay. I’m not a parent myself, but after helping raise my 9-year-old nephew I got the smallest taste of how much work it is to be a parent (why do kids have to spill every single thing possible?) so I love when I see parents post about their kids; you love them and they are perfect in their own way. I also love when people are honest and real about the times that parenting is really, really hard. I’ve seen a lot of this lately too, and I just think its so honest and genuine and real and can make a huge impact on a parent who is having a hard time at the moment.</p>
		<p>Robyn &amp; Tom are very real about parenting. They respect the fact that it isn’t for everyone while also sharing how much they love having kids. They are constantly joking bout how crazy and weird their 2 year old is, but I know for a fact that they would never trade a moment with her for anything.</p>
		<p>I’m so proud of Robyn for raising Audrey, the funniest two-year-old that I know, and now for bringing beautiful baby Natalie into the world too!</p>
		<p>Thanks for trusting me with these photos, I am so honoured that I was able to be involved in special part of your life.</p>
		<p>xoxo Ashley</p>
