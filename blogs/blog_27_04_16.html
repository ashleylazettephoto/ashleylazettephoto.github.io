		<h3>BUD AND DOT</h3>
		<p>Sancia began her signage and calligraphy business just under two years ago. Growing from her love of pretty things and beautiful words, she decided that starting Bud &amp; Dot was the best way for her to share her lovely written talents with others.</p>
		<p>I’ve actually known Sancia since high school, but back then I knew her as this super hot girl who was in a different grade and was better at Drama class than I was. Little did I know, she was actually thinking about becoming a teacher and later&nbsp;started that degree at U of C. During this time her love of photography (and desire to take it to the next level) sparked and she changed her degree from education&nbsp;so she could better manage&nbsp;<em>Sancia Nicole Photography</em>.</p>
		<p>Now her and her husband Mitchell run a very successful photo + film company known as “The Toths”: a company that thrives on telling the stories of people in love.</p>
		<p><strong>Your photo/film business became very popular, very quickly. Did you anticipate that?</strong></p>
		<p>“We definitely didn’t expect our photo + film to take off as quickly as it did. We made a 5 year plan and being able to work solely on this wasn’t scheduled till the last year, but we did it so much sooner! It was amazing.”</p>
		<p><strong>Would you have started Bud + Dot if you knew how busy&nbsp;<em>The Toth’s Photo and Film</em> would be?</strong></p>
		<p>“No, probably not. I’ve chosen not to do many signage requests because our wedding season kicks off in May and is non-stop until September. It’s just not practical for me to be running both businesses in full while also making time for my marriage and family.”</p>
		<p><strong>So how do you keep Bud + Dot in motion without taking on too much?</strong></p>
		<p>“I teach an occasional class with&nbsp;<em>Crafted YYC&nbsp;</em>about Modern Calligraphy. It’s small and I’ve done it enough times that I’m comfortable with it, so it doesn’t require me to prep much. I’ve also done a few commissions here and there, but only for very special occasions. These classes give me an opportunity to share what I’ve learned so far and hopefully people are encouraged to keep going with it. I definitely sometimes bite off more than I can chew but I’m learning to discern when to say yes so that I can put my best foot forward in everything I do. Our business together [with Mitchell] definitely take presidency, but bud and dot is a refreshing change of scenery.”</p>
		<p><strong>So where did the name “Bud + Dot” come from?</strong></p>
		<p>“I’ve always wanted “Bud” and something, but I couldn’t figure out what else it needed for a while. When I finally came up with Bud &amp; Dot, my husband shared that those are actually his grandparents names! It just fit perfectly and was so special that it had extra sentimental value as well.”</p>
		<p><strong>Is it difficult running two businesses with one in a partnership and the other as a solo owner?</strong></p>
		<p>“It [Bud + Dot] started as a side project.. A creative outlet of sorts that was different than photography (which had already become a job at the time). It’s important to me to have things that are mine&nbsp;and Mitchell fully supported me branching out and testing the waters of a small hand lettering business despite the fact that it wasn’t something he would be interested in. The only overlap of the two businesses really is the custom font on all of our videos and client stationary.”</p>
		<p>Sancia is passionate, talented, and a wonderful teacher. She manages to guide people into the world of calligraphy while also sharing her secrets and shortcuts to make it easier. If you follow @budanddot on instagram, I promise that you will be inspired to write pretty things too. Also check out @thetothsphotofilm for some amazing photography/film clips (eventually some of me, since they are doing my wedding!)</p>
		<p>Thanks for sharing Sancia, it’s always lovely hearing about your life and journey. You’re a wonderful inspiration to those of us that started doing one thing, then found a passion for something completely different.</p>
		<p>xoxo Ashley</p>
